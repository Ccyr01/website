          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I am a jr. software developer who loves learning about many things, but I have a keen interest in computers. 
            I've traveled to a couple places in the U.S. and even had the pleasure to live in places such as Texas, New Mexico, and Montana.
            During this time I mad ends meet while cooking in several restaurants. I eventually  decided to make a change and aim for a degree in Computer Science.
            This journey hasn't been the easiest but it is definitely worth it. 
            Iâ€™m ready to take on new challenges to take my developer skills to next level.</p>
          <p>The past ten years of my life I've been a cook, and I'm looking for a change to get in the tech industry.</p>

          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>I have many goals in life. A few are to get my CS degree, buy my mom a car, and to travel to at least 3 different countries.
            I also have a couple business investment plans, but I would keep those to myself for now.

          <p>I am developing skills in several programming languages to be able to 
            make my dreams into reality. Underneath is a list of languages I'm learning.
